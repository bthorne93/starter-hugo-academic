The Python Sky Model (PySM) provides an extensible framework for the simulation of the Galactic microwave sky. 

This framework is widely used within the cosmology community, and forms the basis of the Galactic simulations performed by the major CMB collaborations: *Simons Observatory*, *CMB Stage 4*, and *LiteBIRD*, as demonstrated by its [>100 citations](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=tfNPd34AAAAJ&citation_for_view=tfNPd34AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC). 

As the project has grown in size, its development has become a highly collabortive endeavor. PySM is now managed collaboratively by the [Pan-Experiment Galactic Science Group](https://github.com/galsci).
