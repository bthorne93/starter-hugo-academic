## Overview of Machine Learning

Definition of *machine learning*: 

> The ability of a computer to learn without explicit programming.s

## Supervised vs Unsupervised Machine Learning

*Supervised learning* is used the most in real-world scenarios, and has seen the most rapid advancements in recent years. The first and second courses in this specialization will focus on supervised learning.

*Unsupervised learning* will be covered in course three, and will cover recommender systems and reinforcement learning.

> This course will cover a lot of practical adice for applying learning algorithms.

### Supervised Learning

Andrew Ng claims that 99% of the economic value generated by machine learning today is due to supervised learning.

> Learngs by being given the correct answer.
