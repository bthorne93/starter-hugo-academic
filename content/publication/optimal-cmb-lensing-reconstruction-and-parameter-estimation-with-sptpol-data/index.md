abstract: We perform the first simultaneous Bayesian parameter inference and
  optimal reconstruction of the gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave
  background (CMB), using 100 ${\rm deg}^2$ of polarization observations from
  the SPTpol receiver on the South Pole Telescope. These data reach noise levels
  as low as 5.8 ${\rm \mu K}$ arcmin in polarization, which are low enough that
  the typically used quadratic estimator (QE) technique for analyzing CMB
  lensing is significantly suboptimal. Conversely, the Bayesian procedure
  extracts all lensing information from the data and is optimal at any noise
  level. We infer the amplitude of the gravitational lensing potential to be
  ${A}_{\phi }=0.949\,\pm \,0.122$ using the Bayesian pipeline, consistent with
  our QE pipeline result, but with 17% smaller error bars. The Bayesian analysis
  also provides a simple way to account for systematic uncertainties, performing
  a similar job as frequentist "bias hardening" or linear bias correction, and
  reducing the systematic uncertainty on $A_\phi$ due to polarization
  calibration from almost half of the statistical error to effectively zero.
  Finally, we jointly constrain $A_\phi$ along with $A_L$, the amplitude of
  lensing-like effects on the CMB power spectra, demonstrating that the Bayesian
  method can be used to easily infer parameters both from an optimal lensing
  reconstruction and from the delensed CMB, while exactly accounting for the
  correlation between the two. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the
  Bayesian approach on real data, and pave the way for future analysis of deep
  CMB polarization measurements with SPT-3G, Simons Observatory, and CMB-S4,
  where improvements relative to the QE can reach 1.5 times tighter constraints
  on $A_\phi$ and seven times lower effective lensing reconstruction noise.
