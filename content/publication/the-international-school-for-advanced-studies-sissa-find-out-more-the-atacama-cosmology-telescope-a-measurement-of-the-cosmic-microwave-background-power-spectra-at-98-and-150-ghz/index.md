abstract: We present the temperature and polarization angular power spectra of
  the CMB measured by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) from $5400 {\rm
  deg}^2$ of the 2013-2016 survey, which covers >15000 ${\rm deg}^2$ at 98 and
  150 GHz. For this analysis we adopt a blinding strategy to help avoid
  confirmation bias and, related to this, show numerous checks for systematic
  error done before unblinding. Using the likelihood for the cosmological
  analysis we constrain secondary sources of anisotropy and foreground emission,
  and derive a "CMB-only" spectrum that extends to $\ell=4000$. At large angular
  scales, foreground emission at 150 GHz is ∼1% of $TT$ and $EE$ within our
  selected regions and consistent with that found by Planck. Using the same
  likelihood, we obtain the cosmological parameters for ΛCDM for the ACT data
  alone with a prior on the optical depth of $\tau=0.065\pm 0.015$. ΛCDM is a
  good fit. The best-fit model has a reduced χ2 of 1.07 (PTE=0.07) with
  $H_0=67.9\pm 1.5 {\rm km/s/Mpc}$. We show that the lensing $BB$ signal is
  consistent with ΛCDM and limit the celestial $EB$ polarization angle to
  $\psi_P=−0.07^\circ \pm 0.09^\circ$. We directly cross correlate ACT with
  Planck and observe generally good agreement but with some discrepancies in
  $TE$. All data on which this analysis is based will be publicly released.
