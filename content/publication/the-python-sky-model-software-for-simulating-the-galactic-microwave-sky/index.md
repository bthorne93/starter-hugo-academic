abstract: "We present a numerical code to simulate maps of Galactic emission in
  intensity and polarization at microwave frequencies, aiding in the design of
  Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. This Python code builds on existing
  efforts to simulate the sky by providing an easy-to-use interface and is based
  on publicly available data from the WMAP and Planck satellite missions. We
  simulate synchrotron, thermal dust, free-free, and anomalous microwave
  emission over the whole sky, in addition to the Cosmic Microwave Background,
  and include a set of alternative prescriptions for the frequency dependence of
  each component that are consistent with current data. We also present a
  prescription for adding small-scale realizations of these components at
  resolutions greater than current all-sky measurements. "
