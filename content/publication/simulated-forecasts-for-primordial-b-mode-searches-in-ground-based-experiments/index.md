abstract: Detecting the imprint of inflationary gravitational waves on the
  B-mode polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is one of the
  main science cases for current and next-generation CMB experiments. In this
  work we explore some of the challenges that ground-based facilities will have
  to face in order to carry out this measurement in the presence of Galactic
  foregrounds and correlated atmospheric noise. We present forecasts for Stage-3
  (S3) and planned Stage-4 (S4) experiments based on the analysis of simulated
  sky maps using a map-based Bayesian foreground cleaning method. Our results
  thus consistently propagate the uncertainties on foreground parameters such as
  spatially-varying spectral indices, as well as the bias on the measured
  tensor-to-scalar ratio r caused by an incorrect modelling of the foregrounds.
  We find that S3 and S4-like experiments should be able to put constraints on r
  of the order $\sigma (r)=(0.5−1.0)\times 10−2$ and $\sigma(r)=(0.5−1.0) \times
  10−3$ respectively, assuming instrumental systematic effects are under
  control. We further study deviations from the fiducial foreground model,
  finding that, while the effects of a second polarized dust component would be
  minimal on both S3 and S4, a 2% polarized anomalous dust emission (AME)
  component would be clearly detectable by Stage-4 experiments.
