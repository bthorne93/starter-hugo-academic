abstract: "Emission from the interstellar medium can be a significant
  contaminant of measurements of the intensity and polarization of the cosmic
  microwave background (CMB). For planning CMB observations, and for optimizing
  foreground-cleaning algorithms, a description of the statistical properties of
  such emission can be helpful. Here we examine a machine learning approach to
  inferring the statistical properties of dust from either observational data or
  physics-based simulations. In particular, we apply a type of neural network
  called a Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) to maps of the intensity of emission
  from interstellar dust as inferred from Planck sky maps and demonstrate its
  ability to a) simulate new samples with similar summary statistics as the
  training set, b) provide fits to emission maps withheld from the training set,
  and c) produce constrained realizations. We find VAEs are easier to train than
  another popular architecture: that of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
  and are better-suited for use in Bayesian inference."
